    <div class="Intro">
    	<p>Jamie Cullen was born on November 30th, 1990, in the beautiful county of Wexford, Ireland. <em>Up Wexford!</em><br>
    	He lived a happy life, even though he had to wait 25 years to meet Auriane Scache, which is a long time to wait, to be honest.
        </p>

    	<p>On July 1st, 2016, after a long and tiring day of moving his stuff between appartments in Berlin, he had a date. He came out of the shower half-naked, because he's very modern. She kissed him first at the bar, then they played like children on the Kinderspielplatz at 5am, and cycled to his sofa where they had drunk sex and looked up how to clean period blood. It was the beginning of a long, beautiful, sometimes chaotic and very sincere love story. The sex was so nice and they got along so well that they very naturally and without making a big deal out of it continued to see each other regularly, all of it adding up to them moving in together one year later, in France, to eat saucisson in bed and fuck all the time.

    	<h3 id="list">Here is why Auriane Scache fell in love with Jamie Cullen</h3>
    		<p class="powered"><em>This is a non-exhaustive, unordered list, powered by HTML.</em></p>

    	  <li>He has the sweetest eyes in the world, especially the little wrinkles around them when he smiles because Auriane is funny</li>	
    	  <li>His cheekbones are extremely soft, even a little fragile, and very kissable</li>	
    	  <li>When he's into something, you'll know all about it and soon share his excitement, because he's always into interesting stuff and his passion is contagious</li>	
    	  <li>He is the king that Auriane needed to let her wild submissive self free, and seems to have found a lot of pleasure in the path to being a Dom, which makes both of them sexually unsatiable, yet fulfilled, and adventurous, yet loving and oh so tender </li>	
    	  <li>He's the best</li>	
    	  <li>He REALLY is</li>	
    	  <li>He's honest even if sometimes it's not that easy</li>	
    	  <li>He has a very functional brain that knows a lot of stuff and loves learning and speaks many languages and is good at stuff and all</li>	
    	  <li>He's a free spirit</li>	
    	  <li>He doesn't care about shit stuff and he cares about important stuff</li>	
    	  <li>He makes Auriane feel free</li>	
    	  <li>He's a poat</li>	
    	  <li>And a musician, and it's a well-known fact that musicians get free pussy</li>	
    	  <li>And Auriane's pussy is always free for James</li>	
    	  <li>He's a wonderful human</li>	
    	  <li>He's usually the best at billard, especially when Auriane explains how to play billard in french, and how to touch the boules with the queue</li>	
    	  <li>He does funny dances sometimes</li>	
    	  <li>And funny faces most of the time</li>	
    	  <li>His hands are magic, whether it's for massages, or fingering, or other unrelated matters</li>	
    	  <li>He's the best person to wake up next to every morning and to go to sleep with every night, or the other way around</li>
